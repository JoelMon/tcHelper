# What is tcHelper?
tcHelper is a program to aid public talk coordinators, PTC, in the congregations of Jehovah's Witness.

The project is written in Python3.7 and uses the Qt GUI framework (PySide2) and SQLite3 for its database, all of which are open 
source and cross-platform technologies. Visit the project's wiki for more information. tcHelper grew out of another 
project called [pyTalkManager](https://github.com/TheoDevelopers/pyTalkManager).

tcHelper differentiates its self from other PTC software in a number of ways. For one, it is an open source project. 
Also, tcHelper will not be sold or have features that can only be unlocked with donations. Since tcHelper is open source 
and uses the GPL v.3 license, other PTC software developers can create programs that interact with tcHelper. tcHelper is 
being actively developed and is still in its early stages. Check back every few weeks to keep an eye on the progress.

**tcHelper** is not affiliated with the [Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society of Pennsylvania](https://www.JW.org).
